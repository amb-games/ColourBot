# ColourBot

You are ColourBot, a robot who slaves away in a world where colour is illegal.
Your life is normal, until you one day discover the power of colour.
This discovery leads to your adventure in a world that will never seem the same again.

To play: this is a mouse-only game. Use the left mouse button to move towards the cursor, and the right mouse button to move towards the cursor.

Doors unlock when you are the same colour as them.
You can change the guards' colour (which is sometimes important), but they still hurt you.
Paint mixes with your colour.
Colour shooters override your colour.
